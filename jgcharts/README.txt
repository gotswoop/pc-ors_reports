This is a simple front-end to Google Charts API.
It is not maintained and should probably be replaced with the current Google Charts JS code.
I've made one change for the report: a bug was preventing both colors from appearing on the pie charts. A "fake" series has been added to the color() function to pull in the 2nd color.
